# Getting Started with Rust: A Practical Guide

Rust is a systems programming language that focuses on safety, speed, and concurrency. It has gained tremendous popularity for its innovative approach to memory management without garbage collection through its ownership system. This guide will walk you through the basics of Rust programming with practical examples.

## Why Choose Rust?

Rust offers several compelling advantages:

1. **Memory Safety Without Garbage Collection**: Rust's ownership system prevents common bugs like null pointer dereferencing and data races at compile time
2. **Zero-Cost Abstractions**: High-level constructs compile down to efficient low-level code
3. **Modern Language Features**: Pattern matching, type inference, and a powerful macro system
4. **Great Tooling**: Cargo (package manager), rustfmt (formatter), and Clippy (linter) create a superb developer experience
5. **Growing Ecosystem**: A rapidly expanding library of crates (packages) for various domains

## Setting Up Your Rust Environment

Installing Rust is straightforward with rustup, the Rust toolchain installer:

```bash
# Run this in your terminal
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

After installation, verify everything works:

```bash
rustc --version
cargo --version
```

## Your First Rust Program

Let's create a simple "Hello, World!" program:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, World!");
}
```

Save this in a file called `hello.rs` and compile it with:

```bash
rustc hello.rs
```

Then run the generated executable:

```bash
./hello
```

## Working with Cargo

Cargo is Rust's build system and package manager. Let's create a new project:

```bash
cargo new my_project
cd my_project
```

This creates a new directory with a basic project structure:

```
my_project/
├── Cargo.toml
└── src/
    └── main.rs
```

To build and run your project:

```bash
cargo build    # Compiles the project
cargo run      # Builds and runs the project
cargo check    # Checks if code compiles without producing an executable
```

## Variables and Data Types

Rust is statically typed but has type inference. Variables are immutable by default:

```rust
fn main() {
    // Immutable variable
    let x = 5;

    // This would cause a compile error:
    // x = 6;

    // Mutable variable
    let mut y = 5;
    y = 6; // This works fine

    // Constants require type annotation
    const MAX_POINTS: u32 = 100_000;

    // Multiple variable declaration
    let (a, b) = (1, 2);

    // Basic types
    let integer: i32 = 42;
    let float: f64 = 3.14;
    let boolean: bool = true;
    let character: char = 'z';
    let text: &str = "Hello";

    println!(
        "Values: {}, {}, {}, {}, {}",
        integer, float, boolean, character, text
    );
}
```

## Functions and Control Flow

Functions in Rust are defined using the `fn` keyword:

```rust
fn main() {
    let result = add(5, 3);
    println!("The result is: {}", result);

    // If expression
    if result > 7 {
        println!("Result is greater than 7");
    } else if result > 3 {
        println!("Result is greater than 3 but not greater than 7");
    } else {
        println!("Result is 3 or less");
    }

    // Match expression (pattern matching)
    match result {
        8 => println!("Result is 8"),
        0 => println!("Result is 0"),
        1..=5 => println!("Result is between 1 and 5"),
        _ => println!("Result is something else"),
    }

    // Loop with a counter
    let mut counter = 0;
    while counter < 5 {
        println!("Counter: {}", counter);
        counter += 1;
    }

    // For loop over a range
    for i in 0..5 {
        println!("i: {}", i);
    }
}

// Function with parameters and return value
fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    // The expression without semicolon is the return value
    a + b
}
```

## Ownership: Rust's Killer Feature

Rust's ownership system is its most distinctive feature:

```rust
fn main() {
    // String is a heap-allocated type
    let s1 = String::from("hello");

    // This moves ownership of s1 to s2
    let s2 = s1;

    // This would cause an error - s1 is no longer valid
    // println!("{}", s1);

    // This works fine
    println!("{}", s2);

    // Passing ownership to a function
    takes_ownership(s2);

    // s2 is now invalid
    // println!("{}", s2); // This would cause an error

    // References allow borrowing without taking ownership
    let s3 = String::from("world");

    // &s3 borrows s3 without taking ownership
    let len = calculate_length(&s3);

    // s3 is still valid
    println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", s3, len);

    // Mutable references
    let mut s4 = String::from("hello");
    change(&mut s4);
    println!("Changed string: {}", s4);
}

fn takes_ownership(s: String) {
    println!("{}", s);
    // s goes out of scope and is dropped here
}

fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
    s.len()
    // s is a reference, so it is not dropped here
}

fn change(s: &mut String) {
    s.push_str(", world");
}
```

## Structs and Enums

Structs and enums allow you to create custom data types:

```rust
// Define a struct
struct Person {
    name: String,
    age: u32,
}

// Enum with different variants
enum Message {
    Quit,
    Move { x: i32, y: i32 },
    Write(String),
    ChangeColor(i32, i32, i32),
}

// Methods are implemented using impl blocks
impl Person {
    // Constructor method
    fn new(name: String, age: u32) -> Person {
        Person { name, age }
    }

    // Method with &self parameter (similar to 'this' in other languages)
    fn greet(&self) {
        println!(
            "Hello, my name is {} and I am {} years old.",
            self.name, self.age
        );
    }

    // Method that modifies the instance
    fn have_birthday(&mut self) {
        self.age += 1;
    }
}

impl Message {
    fn call(&self) {
        match self {
            Message::Quit => println!("Quit message received"),
            Message::Move { x, y } => println!("Move to coordinates: ({}, {})", x, y),
            Message::Write(text) => println!("Text message: {}", text),
            Message::ChangeColor(r, g, b) => {
                println!("Change color to: rgb({}, {}, {})", r, g, b)
            }
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    // Create a Person instance
    let mut alice = Person::new(String::from("Alice"), 30);
    alice.greet();

    // Modify the instance
    alice.have_birthday();
    alice.greet();

    // Create and use enum variants
    let m1 = Message::Quit;
    let m2 = Message::Move { x: 10, y: 20 };
    let m3 = Message::Write(String::from("Hello, Rust!"));
    let m4 = Message::ChangeColor(255, 0, 0);

    m1.call();
    m2.call();
    m3.call();
    m4.call();
}
```

## Error Handling in Rust

Rust has a robust error handling system without exceptions:

```rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::{self, Read};

fn main() {
    // Using match for error handling
    let file_result = File::open("hello.txt");

    let mut file = match file_result {
        Ok(file) => file,
        Err(error) => {
            println!("Error opening file: {:?}", error);
            return;
        }
    };

    // Using the ? operator for propagating errors
    let username = read_username_from_file().unwrap_or_else(|error| {
        println!("Error reading username: {:?}", error);
        String::from("default_user")
    });

    println!("Username: {}", username);
}

// Function that returns a Result
fn read_username_from_file() -> Result<String, io::Error> {
    let mut file = File::open("hello.txt")?;
    let mut username = String::new();
    file.read_to_string(&mut username)?;
    Ok(username)
}
```
